# Vehicle-Ownership

Hello, my name is Mathew Chan. I am a person who is looking to learn more about coding and data science. I have worked with programming languages like R, Java, Python, etc. 

The project's purpose is to find a set of variables that are indicators of a change in household vehicle ownership in Maryland. The project is useful for resource allocation in the funding of types of transportation. To get a general idea of the process involved, the three main parts of the project is retrieving the data, manipulating the data, and summarizing the data. Data is retrieved through an API key by the American Community Survey (ACS). Multiple years of data was retrieved for training and one of the years for predicting with the model. The data was trained and manipulated into a format that is compatible of generating a linear model. The model ran through a stepwise function and tested through residual plots. A plot was used to put the predicted model against the actual data and the correlation was compared. The project focuses on Maryland but data from Pennsylvania was retrieved and compared to data from Maryland to show differences in models generated from other states.
